        The creamy ricotta makes a great base into which you can add any melting cheese. I really enjoyed the Cheddar, but I'd like to try this with other options, such as provolone, fontina, or even Gruyère.

    <p>You can substitute veal for the chicken if desired — the technique is the same.

    <ul>Ingredients
<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
<li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
<li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
<li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
<li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
<li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
<li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
<li>
    2 teaspoons olive oil
</li>    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. </li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
