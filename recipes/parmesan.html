    <p>
        The creamy ricotta makes a great base into which you can add any melting cheese. I really enjoyed the Cheddar, but I'd like to try this with other options, such as provolone, fontina, or even Gruyère.

    <p>You can substitute veal for the chicken if desired — the technique is the same.
