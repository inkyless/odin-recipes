    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238691/simple-macaroni-and-cheese/">
    <p>For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni.

        You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra 1/2 cup without ruining the recipe.
        
        Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns easily.
